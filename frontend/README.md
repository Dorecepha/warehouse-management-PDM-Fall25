# 📦 Warehouse Management System — Frontend Team Guide

Welcome to the Warehouse Management System frontend project!  
This guide is written for **beginners**, with simple explanations and clear logic so that anyone can understand what we are building, why we’re building it, and how to contribute successfully.

This README replaces all previous documentation and serves as the **official onboarding guide for the entire team**.

# 🚀 1. Project Overview

The Warehouse Management System consists of two major parts:

- **Backend (Spring Boot)** — the brain that talks to the database  
- **Frontend (React + Tailwind)** — the face that users interact with

Our frontend team is responsible for building all the **pages, buttons, tables, forms, navigation**, and connecting them cleanly to the backend.

This system will allow users to:

- Log in  
- View all warehouse records  
- Add new records  
- Edit existing records  
- Delete records  
- View summary reports  

Everything you build will support one of these goals.

# 🧰 2. Before You Start — Requirements

You must have:

- **Node.js LTS** installed  
- **Git** installed  
- **VS Code** (recommended)

If you do not have these, ask the QA Lead to help.
